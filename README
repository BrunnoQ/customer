# Aplicação Java com API REST para Gerenciamento de customers

## Introdução

In this project, we developed a Java application that offers a REST API to perform operations of registration, modification, deletion, and consultation of customers. The application uses the best development practices, following the REST architecture standards to ensure efficiency, scalability, and ease of integration.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The main programming language, known for its portability and robustness.
- **Spring Boot:** Framework that facilitates the creation of Java applications, providing minimal configuration and increased productivity.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Facilitates interaction with the database, providing an abstraction layer over data persistence.
- **Hibernate:** ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework used to map Java objects to the relational database.
- **RESTful API:** Implementation of a RESTful web services architecture for communication between systems.

## Features

### 1. Customer Registration

The API allows easy and quick registration of new customers. The data is sent via HTTP requests, following the POST method, and is validated to ensure the integrity of the stored data.

### 2. Customer Update
The application allows updating information of already registered customers. The requests are made using the PUT method, ensuring the complete or partial update of the data as necessary.

### 3. Customer Deletion
To remove a customer from the system, the application provides an endpoint using the DELETE method.

### 4. Customer Consultation
The API provides endpoints for customer consultation, allowing the retrieval of specific information or a complete listing. The requests can be made using the GET methods.
